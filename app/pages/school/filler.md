# Filler.md

Literally just a filler file so that in VS Code my "school" folder doesn't automatically collapse down onto the "World's Fair" folder. I prefer the folders to be spaced out individally. I think it makes it more clear for me when I later (possibly) add more school projects to this folder.

Then again, it <i>vertically</i> clutters my sidebar with another file... so maybe this isn't that good an idea.
