    <h1>A Christmas Carol</h1>

    <p>
      This classical Christmas story by Charles Dickens came from the author's
      desire to change public consesus towards helping the poor. The short 1843
      story details a selfish man named Scrooge and the ghostly events that
      encouraged him to change his ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      This story was written during the end of the Industrial Revolution when
      factories and cities created terrible conditions for poorer workers and
      children. It is meant to 'haunt' readers into considering something
      better, like the ghosts do to Scrooge.
    </p>
    <p>
      You, the reader, will be placed in the shoes of Scrooge, and asked to act
      in the otherworldly scenarios that the rich man experienced.
